# Personalized Financial Advice-using-NLP

Abstract:

This project introduces a novel approach to address the user confusion and information
overload experienced on bank websites by proposing a Personalized Financial Advice
Chatbot (PFAC). Traditional bank websites often suffer from complex navigation structures
with numerous submenus, leading to user frustration in locating relevant information.
PFAC aims to mitigate this issue by employing advanced natural language processing and
machine learning techniques to provide tailored financial advice and answers to user
queries. By understanding user intents and preferences, PFAC streamlines the
information-seeking process, enhancing user experience and facilitating better financial
decision-making.
